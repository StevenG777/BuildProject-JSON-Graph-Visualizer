# Build-Project-JSON-Graph-Visualizer

## Features
- **Navigation Menu**: You can navigate between the home and JSON viewer pages through the menu.
- **JSON Viewer**: You can use the JSON viewer to visualize the hierarchical structure of the JSON data

## Functionalities
- **Upload**: Upload JSON file to visualize its data
- **Visualize**: Visualize the hierarchical structure of the JSON data including the attribute names and data type using MaterialUI Tree View
- **Hierarchical Level**: Inspect the hierarchical level of specific data attribute by hovering on it
- **Expand**: Expand a specific level of JSON hierarchy in the visualization
- **Expand All**: Expand all the levels of JSON hierarchy in the visualization
- **Collapse**: Collapse a specific level of JSON hierarchy in the visualization
- **Collapse All**: Collapse all the levels of JSON hierarchy in the visualization
- **Clear Data**: Clear the JSON content
- Future Development:
  - **More Visualize**: Visualization using D3 Tidy Tree/Clustering Tree
  - **Live Server Deployment**: Deploy to live service with choices of Glitch, Netlify or Render
  - **Data Persistence**: Store the data using a key-value store or a document-oriented database

## Tech Stack
- Front-end:
  - HTML, CSS, Typescript, JSX
  - React, React-router, React-spring
  - MaterialUI

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the JSON Graph Visualizer App in the following environments

### Before running any script
1.  Go to the project directory: `cd Your parent directory/Build-Project-JSON-Graph-Visualizer`

### In Development Environment
1. Runs the app in the development mode: `npm start`
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### In Testing Environment
1. Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode: `npm test`
2. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### In Production Environment
1. Build the app for production to the `build` folder: `npm run build`
2. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
3. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
4. Your app is ready to be deployed!
5. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Re-configure and Re-build the app
1. **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**: `npm run eject`
2. If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
3. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
4. You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## My Reflection on This Project
The JSON Graph Visualizer is a project that I did under the guidance of my project leader Sanjeev Vijayara through the Build Project Program by Open Avenues. This is a rewarding experience not only because this web application provides a new perspective on displaying JSON data, but also gives me exposure to using Typescript, React Router, MaterialUI, and building a visualization application.

The JSON Graph Visualizer has two pages: the Home page and the JSON viewer page. The Home contains several components that showcase my understanding on using React
